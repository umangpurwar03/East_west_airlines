PROBLEM STATEMENT
THE KEY ISSUES ARE THE FLYING PATTERN AND THE USE OF FLYER POINT

# ML SUCCESS CRITERIA:ACHIEVE SILHOUTTE COFFICIENT ATLEAST 0.6

# ECONOMIC SUCCESS CRITERIA:IF WE UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS AND REDUCE THE USE OF FLYER POINT THEN THE PROFIT IS AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO INCREASE

# PROPOSED PLANS:
GOUPING THE CUSTOMER IN THE SECTION DEPENDING UPON THE USAGE OF FLYER POINT AND THEIR TRAVELLING PATTERN.
